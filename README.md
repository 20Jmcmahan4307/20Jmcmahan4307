Hi Iâ€™m Jacob, a self taught software developer based in Northwest Arkansas.

I started learning to code in July of 2021. I have learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Node, and I'm learning something new each day. 

I look forward to learning from a community of developers with amazing knowledge and skills, so feel free to reach out at:
